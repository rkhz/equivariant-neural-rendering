# Equivariant Neural Rendering

This is __NOT__ the official repository; it is a fork with modifications made for my research.

If you are interested in the original implementation to reproduce all experiments from [Equivariant Neural Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07630) [E. Dupont et al., ICML 2020], please visit the [official repository](https://github.com/apple/ml-equivariant-neural-rendering).
